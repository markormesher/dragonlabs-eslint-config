# @dragonlabs/eslint-config

My standard ESLint/Prettier config for TypeScript/React/SCSS projects. Published as its own package to reduce duplication between projects.

## Installation and Usage

Install with yarn:

    yarn add -D @dragonlabs/eslint-config

Or install with NPM:

    npm install --save-dev @dragonlabs/eslint-config

Add it to `.eslintrc.json`:

    {
        "extends": "@dragonlabs/eslint-config"
    }

## Why "dragonlabs"?

It was late and I needed a name. DragonLabs is a reference to an old project and was the first thing that came to mind.
